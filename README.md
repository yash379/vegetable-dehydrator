According to reports, India accounts for about 15 percent of the worldâ€™s vegetable
production. But because of the perishable nature of these products, they are difficult
to store over a longer duration of time and most of the time create losses for producers.
To counter this problem, drying has proved to an important aspect when it
comes to storing foods and preserving them. Drying is the oldest method used for
increasing shelf life of food products. It can significantly reduce food wastage. To
achieve this, different types of food dehydrators have been designed and implemented
over the ages. They evaporate moisture content from vegetables using a heat source
such as sunlight (solar energy) or by creating a controlled artificial heating environment.
Drying changes several parameters of the product during the process such as
volume, density, mass, moisture content, product size, chemical changes along with
the product quality.
To achieve optimal dehydration, an electronic temperature control system can be implemented.
In addition, this model can predict the time required for drying the product
based on temperature and humidity. This is made possible with the help of DHT11
temperature and humidity sensors and ESP32 micro-controller. The logic is written
and programmed into the micro-controller
